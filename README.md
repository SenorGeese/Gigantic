# Competitive Gigantic Wiki

This is the Competitive Gigantic Wiki. This is to create a collection of advanced knowledge, tips, and strategies about Gigantic. Because I want to play Gigantic more optimally. Because playing well is fun.

## Gigantic Wiki's?

The general non-competitive focused Gigantic: Rampage Edition wiki is at [https://gogigantic.wiki/](https://gogigantic.wiki/).&#x20;

The official wiki [https://gogigantic.wiki/](https://gogigantic.wiki/) is recommended over the Fandom wiki [https://gigantic.fandom.com/](https://gigantic.fandom.com/), because Gigantic has a history with wiki's. To read more about it, join the [GoGigantic discord server](https://discord.gg/GoGigantic) and read this [Forum about helping the gigantic wiki](https://discord.com/channels/230415910991691776/1216116191068815522/1216116191068815522).&#x20;
