# Gigantic Wiki's?

The official wiki but not competitively focused is at https://gogigantic.wiki/.

The official wiki https://gogigantic.wiki/ is recommended over the Fandom wiki https://gigantic.fandom.com/, because Gigantic has history with wikis. To read more about it, join the GoGigantic discord server and read this Forum (https://discord.com/channels/230415910991691776/1216116191068815522/1216116191068815522) about helping the gigantic wiki.
