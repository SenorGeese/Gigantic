# Margrave

Build: Longer distance and shorter cooldown on your E slam. Longer duration and purify on Q rush. Middle upgrades should be more health and anti-crit. Use deflect shield, and focus gain shield. Use whatever LMB you want. If you want more damage you can use flame on Q rush.

Tip when using your E slam. Jump before pressing the E slam button. Margrave's arc path for the leap is higher when you do it from standing ground compared to when you are from mid air.
