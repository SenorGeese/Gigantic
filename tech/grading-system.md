# Grading System

> The short of it is that the game compares your stats against other players that play the same character, but it's a little bit more involved than that. We group the stats into three different categories: one is offensive, one is defensive, and one is support. The offensive ones are, of course, kills and assists. For defensive ones, you want as few deaths as possible, but it also looks at damage taken. For support, it looks at the healing, buffs, and debuffs that you've done. > > It then compares that against other players that use those categories to determine your playstyle, and then it compares you against other players of that playstyle. If you're in the top 10%, you get an S rank; if you're in the next 15%, you get an A rank, etc.
